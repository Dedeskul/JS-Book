## Creational Design Patterns

1 - Constructor Design Pattern:

Let us create new Object with requested parameters
there are two ways to create new object
first one is Functions
second one is Classes

2 - Factory Design Pattern:

Let us create list of Classes which has their own methods or/and values
Let us create methods which will help to create classes with similar methods and different values

3 - Prototype Design Pattern:

Let us create new object which references to Parrent object using **proto**
allowed method is Object.Create()
created object will be instance of parrent object

4 - SingleTon Design pattern:

let us create object which has only one instance 
each new created variable will be instance of one Class

# Structural Design Patterns 

1 - Adapter Design Pattern

Let us support new functionality using old methods 
takes Class with changes to constructor 
contains methods of old class with old functionality which returns methods from new Class  

2 - Decorator Design Pattern 

Let us add to existed Classes new behavior or functionality
Decorators it's functions which receive some Class instance, modifying that instance and returns it back 

3 - Facade Design Pattern

Let us create more simple or unique interface to interact with other Classes
